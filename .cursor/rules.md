- Always review existing code before changes (reference files like @app/dashboard/page.tsx).
- Use TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion consistently.
- Handle errors gracefully (try/catch, user-friendly toasts).
- Optimize for performance/security (e.g., debounce inputs, RLS in Supabase).
- Make changes modularâ€”add new components/hooks.
- After edits, suggest tests (e.g., console sim for backend).
